# py-channelmodel

We need channel models in wireless communications research all the time. This module tries to provide a model with coherence, power delay profiles, Rayleigh fading, frequency selectivity, and MIMO.

## Installation

The module is available on PyPI. Just run

```
pip3 install py-channelmodel
```
Often, it is desirable to use `pip3 install --user ...`. Also, you need Python 3 for this module. Currently, the module is tested on Python 3.8.


## Usage

```
import channelmodel as channel

channel = channel.ChannelFactory()

# use the channel object
```

## Rationale
The intent of this module is to add a simple set of objects that one instantiates in a simulation. Thus, it should come with minimal dependencies and just provide channel model related operations.

### Supported models

Obviously, this module supports AWGN channels. However, it does also support functions related to Power Delay Profiles, Channel coherence, Time domain channels, frequency domain channels for multicarrier simulations, etc.


## Publications
This module was developed during the research for multiple papers and thus use therein.
